# Raspi Zero CAN Joystick Controller

In this project, we allow real vehicle CAN messages decoded on a Raspberry Pi to control and communicate with Live For Speed (LFS) running on a Windows machine. The method used in this section is a non-direct method and involves the use of an xbox360 emulator.

## Pre-requisite
On the window's machine, download and install all the required drivers and emulators:

1. [_xBox_360_Controller_Emulator_](https://www.x360ce.com/)
2. [_vJoy_Device_Driver_](http://vjoystick.sourceforge.net/joomla256.02/index.php/download-a-install/download)
3. [_Python3_](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
